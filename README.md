# Parameter_optimisation

This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization to the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to evaluate SVM performance across 10 different 70-30 train-test splits, optimize hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV (100 iterations per split), and report the best results. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset before modeling.
